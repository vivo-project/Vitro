#
# This namespace will be used when generating URIs for objects created in the
# editor. In order to serve linked data, the default namespace must be composed
# as follows (optional elements in parentheses):
#
# scheme + server_name (+ port) (+ servlet_context) + "/individual/"
#
# For example, Cornell's default namespace is:
#
# http://vivo.cornell.edu/individual/
#
Vitro.defaultNamespace = http://vivo.mydomain.edu/individual/

#
# URL of Solr context used in local VIVO search. This will usually consist of:
#     scheme + server_name + port + "solr" + solr_core_name
# In a standard Solr installation, the Solr service will be available on port
# 8983. The path will be /solr followed by the name used when adding a core
# for VIVO.
#   Example:
#     vitro.local.solr.url = http://localhost:8983/solr/vivocore
#
vitro.local.solr.url = http://localhost:8983/solr/vivocore

#
# Email parameters which VIVO can use to send mail. If these are left empty,
# the "Contact Us" form will be disabled and users will not be notified of
# changes to their accounts.
#   Example:
#     email.smtpHost = smtp.mydomain.edu
#     email.replyTo = vivoAdmin@mydomain.edu
#
email.smtpHost =
email.replyTo =

# NOTE: VitroConnection.DataSource.* properties are only used in conjuction with
#       an SDB triple store.
#
# The basic parameters for a database connection. Change the end of the
# URL to reflect your database name (if it is not "vitrodb"). Change the username
# and password to match the authorized database user you created.
#
# VitroConnection.DataSource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost/vitrodb
# VitroConnection.DataSource.username = vitrodbUsername

#
# The maximum number of active connections in the database connection pool.
# Increase this value to support a greater number of concurrent page requests.
#
# VitroConnection.DataSource.pool.maxActive = 40

#
# The maximum number of database connections that will be allowed
# to remain idle in the connection pool.  Default is 25%
# of the maximum number of active connections.
#
# VitroConnection.DataSource.pool.maxIdle = 10

#
# Parameters to change in order to use VIVO with a database other than
# MySQL.
#
# VitroConnection.DataSource.dbtype = MySQL
# VitroConnection.DataSource.driver = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
# VitroConnection.DataSource.validationQuery = SELECT 1

# Note: the above parameters allow you to change the relational database that
# is used as the back end for Jena SDB. If you want to use a triple store
# other than SDB, you will need to edit applicationSetup.n3. See the
# installation instructions for more details.

# Argon2 password hashing parameters for time, memory and parallelism required to
# compute a hash.
#
# A time cost defines the amount of computation realized and therefore the execution
# time, given in a number of iterations.
# A memory cost defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
# A parallelism degree defines the number of parallel threads
# For determining the optimal values of the parameters for your setup please refer to
# the white paper section  9

# profile pages that it creates.
#
# For more information, see
# https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/Use+HTTP+caching+to+improve+performance

# considered stale.

# Force VIVO to use a specific language or Locale instead of those

#
# A list of supported languages or Locales that the user may choose to
# use instead of the one specified by the browser. Selection images must
# be available in the i18n/images directory of the theme. This affects
# RDF data retrieved from the model, if RDFService.languageFilter is true.
# This also affects the text of pages that have been modified to support

# Triple pattern fragments is a very fast, very simple means for querying a triple store.
# The triple pattern fragments API in VIVO puts little load on the server, providing a simple means for getting data from the triple store. The API has a web interface for manual use, can be used from the command line via curl, and can be used by programs.
