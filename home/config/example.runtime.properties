# This namespace will be used when generating URIs for objects created in the
# editor. In order to serve linked data, the default namespace must be composed
# as follows (optional elements in parentheses):
#
# scheme + server_name (+ port) (+ servlet_context) + "/individual/"
#
# For example, Cornell's default namespace is:
#
# http://vivo.cornell.edu/individual/
#
Vitro.defaultNamespace = http://vivo.mydomain.edu/individual/

#
# URL of Solr context used in local Vitro search. This will usually consist of:
#     scheme + server_name + port + "solr" + solr_core_name
# In a standard Solr installation, the Solr service will be available on port
# 8983. The path will be /solr followed by the name used when adding a core
# for Vitro.
#   Example:
#     vitro.local.solr.url = http://localhost:8983/solr/vitrocore
#
vitro.local.solr.url = http://localhost:8983/solr/vitrocore

#
# Email parameters which VIVO can use to send mail. If these are left empty,
# the "Contact Us" form will be disabled and users will not be notified of
# changes to their accounts.
  #   Example:
  #     email.smtpHost = smtp.mydomain.edu
  #     email.replyTo = vitroAdmin@mydomain.edu
  #
email.smtpHost =
email.replyTo =

# NOTE: VitroConnection.DataSource.* properties are only used in conjuction with

# The basic parameters for a database connection. Change the end of the
# URL to reflect your database name (if it is not "vitrodb"). Change the username
# and password to match the authorized database user you created.

# VitroConnection.DataSource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost/vitrodb
# VitroConnection.DataSource.username = vitrodbUsername

# The maximum number of active connections in the database connection pool.
# Increase this value to support a greater number of concurrent page requests.
#
# VitroConnection.DataSource.pool.maxActive = 40

#
# The maximum number of database connections that will be allowed
# to remain idle in the connection pool.  Default is 25%
# of the maximum number of active connections.

# tags when executing 'list view' queries that retrieve data

# Argon2 password hashing parameters for time, memory and parallelism required to
# compute a hash.
#
# A time cost defines the amount of computation realized and therefore the execution
# time, given in a number of iterations.
# A memory cost defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
# A parallelism degree defines the number of parallel threads
# For determining the optimal values of the parameters for your setup please refer to
# the white paper section  9

# If an external authentication system like Shibboleth or CUWebAuth is to be

# profile pages that it creates.
#
# For more information, see
# https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/Use+HTTP+caching+to+improve+performance

# Freemarker template or to a Java class would not cause the page to be
# considered stale.

# Force VIVO to use a specific language or Locale instead of those
# specified by the browser. This affects RDF data retrieved from the model,

# languages.forceLocale = en_US

#
# A list of supported languages or Locales that the user may choose to
# use instead of the one specified by the browser. The selected language(s)
# must exist in the Vitro-languages repository. This affects RDF data
# retrieved from the model, if RDFService.languageFilter is true.
# This also affects the text of pages that have been modified to support
# multiple languages.

# Triple Pattern Fragments is a very fast, very simple means for querying a
# triple store.  The Triple Pattern Fragments API in VIVO puts little load on
# the server, providing a simple means for getting data from the triple store.
# The API has a web interface for manual use, can be used from the command line
# via curl, and can be used by programs.
#
# Vitro's Triple Pattern Fragments API does not require authentication and
# makes the full RDF graph available regardless of display or publish levels
# set on particular properties.  Enable Triple Pattern Fragments only if your
# Vitro does not contain restricted data that should not be shared with others.
