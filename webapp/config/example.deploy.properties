# This namespace will be used when generating URIs for objects created in the 
# editor. In order to serve linked data, the default namespace must be composed 
# as follows (optional elements in parentheses):
#
# scheme + server_name (+ port) (+ servlet_context) + "/individual/"
# 
# For example, Cornell's default namespace is:
#
# http://vivo.cornell.edu/individual/
#
Vitro.defaultNamespace = http://vivo.mydomain.edu/individual/

#
# The base install directory for your Tomcat server. The Vitro application 
# will be deployed in the /webapps directory below this base. 
#
tomcat.home = /usr/local/tomcat

#
# The name of the Vitro application. This will be used as the name of the
# subdirectory within your Tomcat server's /webapps directory. It also appears
# in the URL for the application. For example, http://my.vitro.server/vitro
#
webapp.name = vitro

# 
# URL of Solr context used in local Vitro search. This will usually consist of:
#     scheme + server_name + port + vitro_webapp_name + "solr"
# In the standard installation, the Solr context will be on the same server as Vitro,
# and in the same Tomcat instance. The path will be the Vitro webapp.name (specified
# above) + "solr"
#   Example:
#     vitro.local.solr.url = http://localhost:8080/vitrosolr
vitro.local.solr.url = http://localhost:8080/vitrosolr

#
# Restricts access to the Solr search platform. The value is a regular expression.
# When a request is made to Solr, the IP address of the requestor must match the 
# regular expression, or the request will be rejected.
#
# NOTE: don't leave a space on the end of the line, unless you want it to be
# part of the expression. 
#   Examples:
#      vitro.local.solr.ipaddress.mask = 127\.0\.0\.1
#      vitro.local.solr.ipaddress.mask = 127\.0\.0\.1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
#      vitro.local.solr.ipaddress.mask = 169.254.*
