        <display-name>Confirm that the user is authorized for the actions that this page requires.</display-name>
        <description>
        	Confirm that the user is authorized to perform all of the RequestedActions that
        	this page requires. If any of the actions is not authorized, the user will be
        	redirected to the appropriate page.

        	The actions must be found in the "requestedActions" attribute of the request.
        	The attribute may be a RequestedAction or an array of RequestedActions.

        	If the user is not authorized because he is not logged in, he will be directed
        	to the login page, with the current request stored as a post-login destination.

        	If the user is logged in but without sufficient authorization, he will be
        	directed to the home page, which will display an "insufficient authorization"
        	message.
