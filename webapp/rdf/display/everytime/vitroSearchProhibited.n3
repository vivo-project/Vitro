# All instances of a class can be excluded from the search index by adding a 
# vitroDisplay:excludeClass property between vitroDisplay:SearchIndex and the 
# URI of the class that you would like to exclude.

# .n3 or .rdf files can be created in this directory to configure the search 
# exclusions.  Each file must be a valid file in the format specified by its 
# extension. Each file will be loaded individually and must be a complete 
# stand alone example of its format.  Each file must contain all the necessary 
# prefixes, namespaces and preambles required by the format specified by its 
# extension.  

# If you would like to add classes to the exclusions, add a file to this 
# directory ending in .n3 with N3 statements similar to this example.
