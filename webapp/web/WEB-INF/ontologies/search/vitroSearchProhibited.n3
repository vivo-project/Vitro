# All instances of a class can be excluded from the search index
# by adding a vitroDisplay:excludeClass property between 
# vitroDisplay:SearchIndex and the URI of the class 
# that you would like to exclude.

# All .n3 or .rdf files in this directory will be used to configure 
# the search exclusions.  Each file must be a valid file in the format
# specified by its extension. Each file will be loaded individually and
# must be a complete stand alone example of its format.  Each file must contain all
# the necessary prefixes, namespaces and preambles required by the format
# specified by its extension.  

# If you would like to add classes to the
# exclusions, add a file to this directory ending in .n3 with
# N3 statements similar to this example.
