#
# A list of JARs that we know to be required by the source code (and notes on where they are required).
#
# The "jarlist" target of the build script will work on the assumption that these JARs and any JARs
# that they depend on are required by the app.
#
# For example, the JDBC drivers are never explicitly included, but instead are invoked using Class.forName(),
# so they are required even though the "jarlist" target won't find any such requirement.
#

# JDBC drivers that we want to include.
#  Oracle and MySQL
ojdbc14_g.jar
mysql-connector-java-5.1.16-bin.jar

# Don't know who requires the Commons Logging package - Maybe JENA?
commons-logging-1.1.1.jar

# Needed by a variety of JSPs
#    datapropertyBackButtonProblems.jsp
#    n3Delete.jsp
#    processDatapropRdfForm.jsp
#    processRdfForm2.jsp
xstream-1.2.2.jar

# Used in error.jsp, which should probably go away.
cos.jar
