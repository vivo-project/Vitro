This script will try to show that the JARs in a list are not needed for VIVO
(or Vitro).

Given a list of JARs, it will determine what packages the JAR contains, and will
search the source files of the project for references to those packages.

The list of JARs should be created by running the jarlist target of the build file.
That will use JarJar to create a list of JAR file that are not directly referenced
by the classes in the build. But what about JARs that are needed by a call using
reflection? Like Class.forName("this.that.theOther"). We know this is how the MySQL
driver is loaded (so we need mysql-connector-java-5.1.16-bin.jar). Are there any
others? This script will try to find them.

The jarlist target includes a list of JARs that we know are needed, such as the MySQL
connector. If this script finds any JARs that are needed, they should be added to that
list, and the target run again, in case they depend on other JARs in turn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the tricks that this script uses is to prune the list of packages to
search for. If a JAR contains both "this.that.other" and "this.that", then we
only need to search for "this.that", since it will reveal uses of "this.that.other"
as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pass the name of the file that contains the JAR names
pass the root directory of the combined vitro/vivo distro
	(appbase)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Search all of the *.java, *.jsp, *.js, *.tld, *.xml files for mention of these package names
	For each hit, print the file path, line number, the package name and the JAR name.

To search files:
	find -X . -name \*.db -or -name \*pot | xargs grep 'org\.package\.name'
	grep -H -n -f file_with_package_patterns

	or can we do this all with grep on each string?
		grep -r --include=*.jsp

	grep -H -n -r --include=*.javaxd --include=*.jsp org\.package\.name .
		and precede the output with a header that lists the package
